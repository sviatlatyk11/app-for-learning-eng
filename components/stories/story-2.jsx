        When I was six years old, I saw a magnificent picture in a
        book about the jungle called True Stories. It showed a
        boa constrictor swallowing a wild animal. This is what it
        looked like. 
        <br />
        <br />
        In the book it said: ‘Boa constrictors swallow their
        prey whole, without chewing it. Afterwards they are unable to
        move. Then they sleep for six months while they digest.’
        That set me thinking about all the things that go on in
        the jungle and, with a crayon, I did my first drawing. I called it
        drawing number one. It looked like this: 
        <br />
        <br />
        I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups and asked
        if they found it scary.
        They answered: ‘What’s scary about a hat?’
        But my drawing was not of a hat. It was a boa
        constrictor digesting an elephant. So then I drew the inside of
        the boa, to help the grown-ups understand. They always need
        explanations. This is what my drawing number two looked
        like: 
        <br />
        <br />
        The grown-ups told me to forget about drawing
        elephants inside boa constrictors and to concentrate instead
        on geography, history, arithmetic and grammar. Which is
        why, at the age of six, seeing as my drawing number one and
        my drawing number two had been such a disaster, I gave up
        on a glorious career as an artist. Grown-ups never
        understand anything on their own, and it’s nuisance for
        children to have to keep explaining things over and over
        again.
        <br />
        <br />
        So I had to choose another profession, and I learned
        to be a pilot. I flew all around the world. And it is true that
        geography came in very handy. I could tell the difference
        between China and Arizona at a glance. Which is very useful,
        if you lose your way at night.
        <br />
        <br />
        Over the past years, I have met lots of sensible people
        and spent a lot of time living in the world of grown-ups. I
        have seen them at close quarters, which has done nothing to
        change my opinion of them.
        <br />
        <br />
        Whenever I met a grown-up who seemed fairly
        intelligent, I would test him with my drawing number one
        which I have always kept, to find out if he really was
        perceptive. But he would always reply: ‘It’s a hat.’ So instead
        of talking to him about boa constrictors or the jungle or the
        stars, I’d come down to his level and discuss bridge, golf,
        politics and neckties. And the grown-up would be delighted to
        meet such a reasonable man
        <br />
        <br />
        And so I lived alone, with no one I could really talk to, until
        six years ago when my plane broke down in Sahara
        Desert. As I did not have a mechanic with me, or any
        passengers, I was going to have to make a complicated
        engine repair on my own. My life depended on it, since I had
        barely enough drinking water to last for only 8 days.
        The first night, I lay down on the ground and fell
        asleep, miles and miles from any living soul. I was more cut
        off than a castaway adrift in the middle of the ocean. So you
        can imagine my astonishment when I was awakened at
        daybreak by a funny little voice saying: “Please, will you draw
        me a little lamb?”
        <br />
        <br />
        “What”
        <br />
        <br />
        “Draw me a little lamb…”
        I leaped to my feet as if I had been struck by lightning.
        I rubbed my eyes and stared. And I saw the most
        extraordinary little fellow studying me intently. This is the
        best picture I have managed to draw of him from memory.
        But of course my drawing is not nearly as delightful as
        the original. That is not my fault; the grown-ups had put a
        stop to my artistic career when I was six and I had never
        drawn anything other than my two boa constrictors.
        <br />
        <br />
        I gazed at him in amazement. I was miles and miles
        from any living soul, remember. But my little fellow did not
        look lost. Nor did he seem weak with exhaustion, or hunger,
        or thirst, or fright. In no way did he look like a child lost in the
        middle of the desert miles and miles from any living soul.
        When at last I found my voice, I said to him: “What on earth
        are you doing here?
        <br />
        <br />
        And he repeated, very quietly, as if it were a matter of
        the utmost seriousness: “Please, will you draw me a little
        lamb?”
        <br />
        <br />
        Here I was, miles and miles from any living soul and
        with my life in danger, but I was so baffled that I meekly
        prepared to do as he asked and took a pen and paper out of
        my pocket. And then I remembered that I had mostly studied
        geography, history, arithmetic and grammar, and I told the
        little fellow (somewhat irritably) that I couldn’t draw. And he
        replied: “It doesn’t matter. Draw me a little lamb.”
