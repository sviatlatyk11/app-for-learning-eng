        Tom Sawyer lived with his aunt because his mother and
        father were dead. Tom didn’t like going to school, and he
        didn’t like working. He liked playing and having
        adventures. One Friday, he didn’t go to school—he went
        to the river.
        <br />
        <br />
        Aunt Polly was angry. “You’re a bad boy!” she said.
        “Tomorrow you can’t play with your friends because you
        didn’t go to school today. Tomorrow you’re going to work
        for me. You can paint the fence.”
        Saturday morning, Tom was not happy, but he started to
        paint the fence. His friend Jim was in the street.
        Tom asked him, “Do you want to paint?”
        <br />
        <br />
        Jim said, “No, I can’t. I’m going to get water.”
        Then Ben came to Tom’s house. He watched Tom and
        said, “I’m going to swim today. You can’t swim because
        you’re working.”
        <br />
        <br />
        Tom said, “This isn’t work. I like painting.”
        “Can I paint, too?” Ben asked.
        <br />
        <br />
        “No, you can’t,” Tom answered. “Aunt Polly asked me
        because I’m a very good painter.”
        Ben said, “I’m a good painter, too. Please, can I paint? I
        have some fruit. Do you want it?”
        <br />
        <br />
        OK,” Tom said. “Give me the fruit. Then you can paint.”
        Ben started to paint the fence. Later, many boys came to
        Tom’s house. They watched Ben, and they wanted to
        paint, too.
        Tom said, “Give me some food and you can paint.” 
        <br />
        <br />
        Tom stayed in the yard, and the boys painted. They
        painted the fence three times. It was beautiful and white.
        Tom went into the house. “Aunt Polly, can I play now?”
        he asked.
        <br />
        <br />
        Aunt Polly was surprised. “Did you paint the fence?”
        she asked.
        “Yes, I did,” Tom answered.
        Aunt Polly went to the yard and looked at the fence. She
        was very surprised and very happy. “It’s beautiful!” she
        said. “Yes, you can play now.”
        <br />
        <br />
        Tom walked to his friend Joe Harper’s house and played
        with his friends there. Then he walked home again. There
        was a new girl in one yard. She had yellow hair and blue
        eyes. She was beautiful. Tom wanted to talk to her, but she
        didn’t see him. She went into her house. Tom waited, but
        she didn’t come out again.
        <br />
        <br /> 
        One morning before school, Tom’s friend Huck Finn
        waited for him in the street. Huck didn’t have a home, and
        he never went to school. People in the town didn’t like
        him. But Tom liked Huck.
        <br />
        <br />
        Huck said, “Let’s have an adventure.”
        “What can we do on our adventure?” Tom asked.
        “Let’s go to the graveyard at night—at twelve o’clock!”
        Huck answered.
        <br />
        <br />
        ‘That’s a good adventure,” Tom said. “Let’s meet at
        eleven o’clock.”
        Then Tom went to school, but he was late. The teacher
        was angry. He asked, “Why are you late again?”
        <br />
        <br />
        “I’m late because I talked to Huck Finn,” Tom said.
        Then the teacher was very angry. “Sit with the girls,” he
        said to Tom.
        Tom sat near the beautiful new girl. He was happy. He
        looked at her.
        <br />
        <br />
        “What’s your name?” he asked.
        “Becky,” she answered.
        <br />
        <br />
        Tom smiled and said, “My name’s Tom.”
        The teacher was angry again. “Tom Sawyer, stop
        talking! Go to your place now,” he said. Tom went to his
        place.
        <br />
        <br />
        At twelve o’clock Tom and Becky didn’t go home. They
        stayed in the school yard and talked. Tom said, “I love
        you. Do you love me?”
        <br />
        <br />
        “Yes,” Becky answered.
        “Good,” Tom said. “Then you’re going to walk to
        school with me every day. Amy always walked with me.”
        “Amy!” Becky said angrily. “Do you love her?”
        “No,” Tom answered. “I love you now. Do you want to
        walk with me?”
        <br />
        <br />
        But Becky was angry with Tom. She walked away and
        didn’t answer. Tom was unhappy. He didn’t go to school
        in the afternoon.
